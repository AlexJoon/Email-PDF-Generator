# Email-PDF-Generator

Ruby User Input Program that inputs in a person's information from their personal information, occupation and address.

The program then takes that data and sorts it into different categories based on: Personal, Address & Occupation.

After the sort is complete, it is then saved onto a .pdf file which is made when the User has finished all of the person data that they wish to input.
